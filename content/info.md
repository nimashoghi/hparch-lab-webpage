__SARAV__ is an undergraduate oriented research group that focuses on systems and architecture for robotics and autonomous vehicles. The group members are mainly from Georgia Tech undergraduate students and advised by [Ramyad Hadidi](https://ramyadhadidi.github.io/) (PhD candidate), [Jiashen Cao](https://jiashenc.github.io/cv/) (MS student) and [Prof. Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/). The group belongs to [HpArch](http://hparch.gatech.edu/) group at Georgia Tech.

You can check our demos, publications, and a short description of previous/current projects below.
