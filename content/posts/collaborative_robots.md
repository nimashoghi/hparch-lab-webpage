Project Start: Fall 19


## Fall19
A group of sorter robots that sort some limited objects by putting them in designated areas. Objects are easy and light to grab with robot arms (pre-determined on how to grab, or with some extra tools). Emphasis is more on collaborative work.
​
The collaborative robots project involved working with Raspberry Pis, iRobot Create 2 robots, robotic arms, and object detection in order to classify and sort a set of recycling objects.
